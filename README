*TODO*

For Code;
1- separate ui into .ui.qml files to contain elements and there layout/arrangements
2- use QSettings, use header files only for constants
3- use an FSM to manage user interaction; for example using power button to navigate to next creen, cancel, turn heater on and off, be checkable as needed, etc.
4- add build config for local debugging that loads from filesystem and not resources
5- have a "retransalteUi()" to "hot" language switch without reload
6- preferably separate ui process from hw control processes to be more resilient to HW crashes, since no realtime requirements exist
7- db to store data locally,  use db migrations code to manage db upgrades
8- a code to check for and manage updates
9- handle cases like HW failure, alarms
10- for me in manual settings UI I'd use to big knowbs/dials in the same screen for time and tempterature, withou the need to slide to another panel, the timer
11- catch more categorized logs
